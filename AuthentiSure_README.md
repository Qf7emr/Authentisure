# AuthentiSure: Continuous Behavior-Based Authentication for Mobile Banking

## Overview
AuthentiSure is a smart, privacy-focused solution designed to enhance mobile banking security by continuously verifying user identity based on behavioral biometrics. It protects users from fraud such as account takeovers and session hijacking by analyzing swipe patterns, typing dynamics, device handling, and location trends in real-time.

## Features
- Continuous authentication using behavior-based biometrics  
- Lightweight on-device machine learning for real-time anomaly detection  
- Adaptive security responses based on risk levels  
- Privacy-first design with federated learning and local data processing  
- Designed for diverse user groups including elderly and differently-abled users  

## How It Works
1. AuthentiSure collects subtle behavioral data during user interaction without interrupting the user experience.  
2. A locally running ML model builds and updates a profile of typical user behavior.  
3. Anomalies trigger security actions such as step-up authentication or session termination.  
4. No raw data leaves the device, ensuring privacy and regulatory compliance.  

## Tech Stack
- Android (Kotlin) for the mobile app prototype  
- Python for ML model prototyping  
- TensorFlow Lite for on-device ML inference  
- Federated learning techniques for privacy-preserving model updates  

## Future Work
- Build and test a working prototype app  
- Collect real user data with consent to improve model accuracy  
- Optimize energy consumption and model performance  
- Design user-friendly alert and re-authentication flows
